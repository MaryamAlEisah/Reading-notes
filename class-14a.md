## What is Transforms ?

The **`transform`** property comes in two different settings, _two-dimensional_ and _three-dimensional_. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

### Transitions :

for a **`transition`** to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the **`:hover`**,**` :focus`**,**`:active`** , and **`:target`** pseudo-classes.
