# Javascript language

JavaScript is added to enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site. Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the javascript. 

In **JavaScript**, almost "everything" is an **object**.

* Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Dates are always objects
* Maths are always objects
* Regular expressions are always objects
* Arrays are always objects
* Functions are always objects

All *JavaScript* values, except primitives, are *objects*.
