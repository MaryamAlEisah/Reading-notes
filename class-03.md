# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

 

## What is HTML lists?

In **`HTML`** there are *three typse of lists*:
  
 
* **Ordered lists**:
 Are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
* **Unordered lists**:
Are lists that begin with a bullet point.
* **Definition lists**:
 Are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

## CSS Boxes :

In `CSS` the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It **consists** of:

 1. Margins.
 2. Borders. 
 3. Padding
 4. Content.

### What is an Array?

 **Array** is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

### How creating an Array?

First, you must declare a variable of the desired array type. Second, you must allocate the memory that will hold the array, using new, and assign it to the array variable. Thus, in Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.

## for Loops
for loops have a unique syntax, similar to the if statement, but slightly more complex. First, we have the for keyword, followed by parentheses, and then open and close braces. Within the parentheses, we will need three things:

* First, we must declare a variable. This is what the loop will be looping over. 
* Then, we will have a conditional expression. The loop will continue happening until this statement is false. 
* Third, we will increment our variable. All three of these statements are separated by a semicolon.



## Why use else if?

To know the reason you should remember that when using an if/else if block, only ONE of the statements will be run, even if there are multiple statements that are true. The same can not be said for multiple if statements; they will run if true no matter what.


## Switch statement 

The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case, as well as statements in cases that follow the matching case.


 ### JavaScript *Comparison* and *logical operators*:

**Comparison operators** are used in *logical statements* to determine equality or difference between variables or values:


* (==) &#10230;	equal to		
	
* (===) &#10230;	equal value and equal type	

* (!=) &#10230;	not equal	

* (!==) &#10230;	not equal value or not equal type		

* (>) &#10230;	greater than		

* (<) &#10230; less than	

* (>=) &#10230;	greater than or equal to	

* (<=) &#10230;	less than or equal to

**Logical operators** are used to determine *the logic* between variables or values:

* (&&) &#10230; and		
* (||) &#10230;	or		
* (!)	&#10230; not	and		
* (||) &#10230;	or		
* (!) &#10230;	not
