## Images :

### How we can control the size of an image using CSS ?
  

We can resize the`image` by specifying the **width** and **height** of an image. 
A common solution is to use the *`max-width: 100%;`* and *`height: auto;`* so that large images do not exceed the width of their container. 
The max-width and max-height properties of CSS works better, but they are not supported in many browsers.

## How we can align Images ?

Aligning an image means positioning the image at center, left, and right. We can use the float property and text-align property for the alignment of images. If the image is in the `div element`, then we can use the text-align property for aligning the image in the `div`.

## Background-position:


When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background
image should be placed.
This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the
second represents the vertical.
