# CSS layout


## layout tools and techniques available in CSS
**Normal Flow :**
Elements on web pages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. 

**Flexbox:**
It is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. 

**Grids:**
It is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. 

**Floats:**
Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on web pages.

**Positioning:**
Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. 

**Multiple-column layout:**
The multiple-column layout specification gives you a method of laying content out in columns, as you might see in a newspaper.

**Legacy layout methods:**
Grid systems are a very common feature used in CSS layouts, and before CSS Grid Layout they tended to be implemented using floats or other layout features.
