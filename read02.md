# GIT Introduction #

  *GIT* is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to being lost.

1. **States**:

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

2. **Committed**:

Data is securely stored in a local database

3. **Modified**:

The file has been changed but not committed to the database
