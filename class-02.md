# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS 

## What is HTML?
**`HTML`** : (Hyper Text Markup Language), it is the standard markup language for creating Web pages and describes the structure of a Web page. **HTML** consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content. 
  
## Semantic Elements in HTML
 
* `<article>`
* `<aside>`
* `<details>`
* `<figcaption>`
* `<figure>`
* `<footer>`
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<mark>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
* `<summary>`
* `<time>`



## What is HTML Structural Markup?
Structure is the information components within an **HTML** document. For instance: headings, lists and paragraphs.

**HTML** provides some elements that are strictly "structural" - meaning that they are used to define the structure for a web page, in semantic terms. Structural markup encodes information about an element's role. There are paragraph containers, heading containers, a variety of list containers, containers for creation and organization of tables. There are inline containers that indicate that text should be emphasized and strongly emphasized.


| Tags Name | Tags |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header| `<H1>`,....`<H6>`|
| Paregraph | `<p>`|
| Bold| `<B>`|
| Italic | `<i>`|
| Line break | `<br />`|
| Horizontalrules | `<hr />`|


## What is CSS?

* **CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* **CSS** describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
* **CSS**  saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
* External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

## Why use External Style Sheets?
The advantage of *external stylesheets* is that it can be created once and the rules applied to multiple web pages. Should you need to make widespread changes to your site design, you can make a single change in the stylesheet and it will be applied to all linked pages, saving time and effort.

## What is JavaScript?

**`JavaScript`** is high-Level Programming Language often abbreviated as **JS** can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly.

 **Statement** Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 

**Comments** You should write it to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and it can help you and others to read your code.


## What is a variable? 
**JavaScript** includes **variables** which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name.

#### Rules for naming **variables** :
1. The name must begin with a *letter*, ($) or an *underscor* (_).
2. You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
3. The name can contain letters,numbers,($), or an underscore (_).
4. You must not use a dash(-) or aperiod (.) in a variable name.

### What is an Array?

 **Array** is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

### How creating an Array?

First, you must declare a variable of the desired array type. Second, you must allocate the memory that will hold the array, using new, and assign it to the array variable. Thus, in Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.

 ### JavaScript *Comparison* and *logical operators*:

**Comparison operators** are used in *logical statements* to determine equality or difference between variables or values:


* (==) &#10230;	equal to		
	
* (===) &#10230;	equal value and equal type	

* (!=) &#10230;	not equal	

* (!==) &#10230;	not equal value or not equal type		

* (>) &#10230;	greater than		

* (<) &#10230; less than	

* (>=) &#10230;	greater than or equal to	

* (<=) &#10230;	less than or equal to

**Logical operators** are used to determine *the logic* between variables or values:

* (&&) &#10230; and		
* (||) &#10230;	or		
* (!)	&#10230; not	and		
* (||) &#10230;	or		
* (!) &#10230;	not

### What is a *string operator* in JavaScript?
Joining multiple strings together is known as **concatenation**. The concatenation operator. The concatenation operator (+) concatenates two or more string values together and returns another string which is the union of the two operand strings. The shorthand assignment operator += can also be used to concatenate strings.
###

**Evaluations**
You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they
match expected results. 

**Decision**
Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.

**Loops** 
It helps you where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.

**Using For loop**:
